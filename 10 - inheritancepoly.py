            # Inheritance is the idea of reusing a class if the new class is similar to the original class.

# super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods
# Polymorphism - Polymorphism variations in classes based on the functions I have.
    # diff froms of function between classes w same name
    # same methods in diff classes with specific def for each
